# PixelForge

**PixelForge** is an AI-powered logo generation platform built during  AMUHACKS 4.0 that enables anyone to create unique, professional-grade logos by simply describing their brand in natural language. Whether you're an entrepreneur, designer, or student, PixelForge brings powerful design tools to your fingertips ‚Äî no experience required.

## üîç Description

PixelForge solves the problem of expensive, time-consuming, and skill-intensive logo design. With just a short text prompt describing your brand's personality, vision, and style, our platform generates high-quality, personalized logos using generative AI models.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Proposed System

The platform uses a prompt-to-image pipeline that works as follows:
1. The user provides a textual brand description.
2. The system processes the input with an LLM to create a suitable design prompt.
3. That prompt is passed to an image generation model (like FLUX.1 or FastAI).
4. The generated logo is displayed and can be saved or downloaded.

**Tech Features:**
- AI-powered logo prompt generation.
- Image generation via Hugging Face model inference.
- Firebase Firestore for storing logos.
- Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Axios.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Existing System and Drawbacks

### Existing Tools:
- Canva, Looka, Wix Logo Maker, Photoshop, etc.

### Limitations:
- Mostly template-based with minimal originality.
- Requires manual editing and design sense.
- Often gated behind premium subscriptions.
- Generic outputs with limited customization.

**PixelForge** eliminates these issues by:
- Using pure generative AI (not templates).
- Allowing full customization via natural language.
- Delivering original and unique logo designs instantly.
- Being free and open to all.

## üí° Key Use Cases

- New startups looking for instant brand identity.
- Students creating logos for academic or personal projects.
- Freelancers needing fast and creative logo solutions.
- Hackathon teams needing a brand logo on the fly.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges We Ran Into

- Parsing the AI prompt outputs when the LLM included markdown syntax (e.g., ```json blocks).
- Axios 401 errors due to misconfigured Hugging Face API keys.
- Async data handling between prompt generation and image generation.
- Firebase data structure design for organized storage.

We tackled these with detailed error logging, sanitizing prompt responses, and restructuring request payloads properly.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
